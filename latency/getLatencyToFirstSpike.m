function LatencyFirstSpike = getLatencyToFirstSpike(spikeTrl_Pulse, pulseEpochs)
% This function is meant to calculate the latency to the First spike after
% optostim
%
%   USAGE
%   LatencyFirstSpike = getLatencyToFirstSpike(spikeTrl_Pulse, pulseEpochs)
%
%   Dependencies:
%   
%
%   INPUTS
%   spkTrl_Pulse    - spiketimes centered to pulse is 0, struct with
%                      {iUnit}{iPulse}
%   pulseEpochs     - Nx2 matrix of start and stop times 
%
%
%   OUTPUTS
%     LatencyFirstSpike - Nx1 For each trial in PulseEpochs the latency that it
%     took for the first spike to occur
%
%   EXAMPLES
%   LatencyFirstSpike = getLatencyToFirstSpike(peth.trials{iUnit},pulseEpochs)
